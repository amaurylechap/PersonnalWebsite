**Mission:** Design a cost-constrained one-way attack drone (&lt;€5,000 per unit target) in a fast-moving environment.

**Team:** Led 7 engineers from multiple countries.

**Process:** Analytical + empirical design; intense iteration (≈10 structural layout revisions; 6 landing gear geometry changes in &lt;6 months).

**Manufacturing:** Solved composite bottlenecks with a design manufacturable in **&lt;50 hours of non-specialized labor** using standard workshop tooling.

**Culture:** "You have 1 km runway—test as soon as possible." Validated control-surface hinge moments without wind tunnel.
