**Objective:** Navigate in GPS-denied environments using optical systems.

**Approach:** Combined classical odometry with AI image recognition to cancel dead-reckoning drift. Integrated by emulating an NMEA GPS feed into the autopilot (plug-compatible).

**Outcome:** Managed a 16 km flight with ~50 m precision without GPS in under a month of development.

**Notes:** Focus on rapid calibration, field validation loops, and integrating with existing autopilot pipelines.
