**Problem:** Composite rotor components lose strength via wear and crack propagation; must be safe and light.

**Work:** Pre-sizing with load spectrum mapped to the fitting's local frame; optimized layup for manufacturability, fatigue resistance, and weight; ensured CS-29 compliance. Geometry in CATIA (GSD), meshing & stack optimization in Altair, structural solution in SAMCEF.
