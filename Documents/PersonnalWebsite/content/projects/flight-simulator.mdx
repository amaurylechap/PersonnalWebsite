Built a realistic flight simulator based on real flight-test data and a linear model framework. The most accurate model is a Cessna 172, but users can input basic aircraft parameters to instantly synthesize coherent dynamics. Explored an autonomous dogfighting autopilot; revisiting with stronger AI background.
