Shark Aero produces high-performance composite ultralights (≈300 km/h cruise, >2,000 km range).  

I coordinated demo flights across France, organized marketing events, provided after-sales support, and led the Le Bourget booth operations, including the presentation of military variants. I also presented a military aircraft equipped with EW systems to South American armed forces at age 23, reinforcing preparation, composure, and clear communication.
