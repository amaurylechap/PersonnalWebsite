    "I build and ship flying systems fast—iterate, test, learn, and make it work.",
  summary: `I'm an aerospace engineer who believes in fast iteration, field testing,
and learning from real-world performance. I care less about polished theory and more about building
systems that actually fly, survive, and deliver value. What you'll see here reflects that mindset:
simple ideas tested quickly, refined repeatedly, and pushed until they work.`,
  availability: "Open to collaboration and full-time roles.",
